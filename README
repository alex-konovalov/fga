                     Free Group Algorithms

                        A GAP 4 package


Contents:
---------

The FGA package provides methods for computations with finitely
generated subgroups of free groups.
It allows to test membership and conjugacy, and to compute free
generators, the rank, the normalizer, centralizer, and index, where
the groups involved are finitely generated subgroups of free groups.
It also allows the computation of preimages of homomorphisms of such
groups.
In addition, it provides a finite presentation for the automorphism
group of a finitely generated free group.


Requirements:
-------------

FGA is written for GAP version 4.4.  It does not use external programs
and does not depend on system specifics.


Installation:
-------------

The installation follows standard GAP rules.
So the normal way to install is to unpack the archive in the `pkg'
directory, which will create an `fga'subdirectory.


Enjoy!
